  ## Description

  This Book Search app is allows users to search for books using the Google Books API and save them to their profile.  This project began as a fully functioning app built with a RESTFUL API.  The project was to refactor the code to be a GraphQL API build with Apollo Server.  The app is now built using the MERN Stack, with a REACT front end, MongoDB database, Node.js/Express.js server, and Google Books API.  Uses JSON Web Token (JWT) for user authentication/login.
